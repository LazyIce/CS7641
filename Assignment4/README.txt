For this assignment, I used the Reinforcement Learning - Simulator developed by developed by Rohit Kelkar and Vivek Mehta at Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University.

The reference link: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awm/rlsim/

The 'RL_sim' folder is the uncompressed material downloaded at above link.

You can see the introduction and instructions on the above link or in the 'help' folder.

To run the program, under 'RL_sim' directory, run command 'java -jar rl_sim.jar' and choose the maze.

For my experiments, the two mazes -- small.maze and large.maze are in the 'mymazes' folder.
