# CS7641 Machine Learning

These are all 4 assignments for the CS7641 Machine Learning course.

## Supervised Learning
In this assignment, I implemented five learning algorithms. 
They are for:

- Decision trees with some form of pruning
- Neural networks
- Boosting
- Support Vector Machines
- k-nearest neighbors

## Randomized Optimization
In this assignment, I implemented four local random search algorithms. They are:

- randomized hill climbing
- simulated annealing
- a genetic algorithm
- MIMIC

Then I used the first three algorithms to find good weights for a neural network.


## Unsupervised Learning and Dimensionality Reduction

In this assignment, I implemented five algorithms. The first two are clustering algorithms:

- k-means clustering
- Expectation Maximization

The last three algorithms are dimensionality reduction algorithms:

- PCA
- ICA
- Randomized Projections


## Markov Decision Processes
In this assignment, I explored Markov Decision Processes (MDPs):

- Come up with two interesting MDPs.
- Solve each MDP using value iteration as well as policy iteration.
- Soleve this MDP with Q-learning.
